Facebook Hackathon 2015
Todd Davies & Martyn Jacques

This is an application I created alongside Todd Davies (GH: Todd-Davies) at the 2015 Facebook Hackathon at their London officies.

We built a simple server written in Python using the Flask framework (http://flask.pocoo.org), and built a web front end using javascript.
